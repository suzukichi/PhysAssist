As a physics major, I want one place where I can see all the formulas and
constants I need for a certain topic, so that I can save time and focus on
studying and doing practice problems.

As a physics professor, I want to be able to use pre-made diagrams when
teaching my class, so that I can save time from drawing the same thing on the
board, and can use that time answering questions about the material.

As a visual learner, I want to be able to see examples and drawings of problems
I will encounter in my physics class, so that I can learn on my own time when
the teacher is not available to show me new problems similar to those in my
notes.
